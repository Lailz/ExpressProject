Next, we will install `Express`:

```shell
    yarn add express
```

To create our `Express` app, we will use the `express` method. This method simply creates your app.

```javascript
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
```

We will set our development server using the `listen` method.

```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("The application is running on localhost:3000");
});
```

The `listen()` method takes two arguments: the port number which will be 3000, and a callback function -which is optional- that we will use to console log the port number in the terminal.

We can now access our app at `localhost:3000`.
