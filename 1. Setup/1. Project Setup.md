Create your project folder using the `mkdir` command in the terminal. Let's call it `CakeShopAPI`. Then, we'll `cd` inside our folder.

```shell
    mkdir CakeShopAPI
    cd CakeShopAPI
```

Next we will create a `node` environment with the default options:

```shell
    yarn init -y
```

Note that your folder was empty, but after running the command above, we now have a `package.json` file.

Next, create a file called `app.js` in your project folder. Open the `package.json` file and change the `main` property value to `app.js` as shown below:

```javascript
  "main": "app.js",
```

We will also write a script that runs the application and watches for any changes using `nodemon` in the app:

```javascript
{
  "name": "cake-shop-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  }
}
```

If it's your first time using `nodemon`, you'll need to install it globally:

```shell
  yarn global add nodemon
```
