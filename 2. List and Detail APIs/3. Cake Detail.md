To fetch one cake object by its ID, instead of creating a route for every cake object, we will create one route that has the ID, and we will capture the value from the URL.

Let's say a request was sent to the following URL: `/cakes/3`. The response to this request is the cake object with the ID 3. To access the cake with the ID `3` we will do the following:

```javascript
app.get("/cakes/:cakeId", (req, res) => {
  const { cakeId } = req.params;
  const cake = cakes.find(_cake => _cake.id === +cakeId);
  res.json(cake);
});
```

We called our route parameter `cakeId`. So, the ID passed through the URL is saved inside `req.params.cakeId`.

We then compare the `cakeId` value to the IDs in the `cakes` array to fetch the `cake` object with the same ID through the `find` method. Finally we return the found cake as a JSON object.

This is what the response will look like in Postman:
