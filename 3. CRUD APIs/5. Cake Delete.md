To delete an existing cake, we will use the `delete` method. All we need is the cake ID, so we will receive it through a route parameter as shown below. Then we will pass the `cakeId` to the `getCake` method, which will fetch the cake that we want to delete.

After that we will pass the fetched cake to the `deleteCake` method which will delete this cake from the database.

Finally, just like update requests, by convention, delete requests return no content. So we basically send back the status code `204` to indicate that the update went as expected, and we use the `end` method to end the response.

```javascript
app.delete("/cakes/:cakeId", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const cake = await cakeMethods.getCake(req.params.cakeId);
    await cakeMethods.deleteCake(cake);
    res.status(204).end();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error while deleting a cake!", error);
  }
});
```
