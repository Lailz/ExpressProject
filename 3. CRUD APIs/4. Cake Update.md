To update an existing cake, we will use the `put` method. The user will send the updated cake's data in the body of the request and the cake's id as a route parameter.

First we will fetch the cake that we want to update from the database through the `getCake` method, then we will update all of its fields with the new data saved in the request's body, and finally we will send the updated cake to the `updateCake` method.

By convention, update requests return no content. So we basically send back the status code `204` to indicate that the update went as expected, and we use the `end` method to end the response.

```javascript
app.put("/cakes/:cakeId", async (req, res) => {
  const cake = req.body;
  try {
    const _cake = await cakeMethods.getCake(req.params.cakeId);
    _cake.name = cake.name;
    _cake.price = cake.price;
    _cake.image = cake.image;
    await cakeMethods.updateCake(_cake);
    res.status(204).end();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error while updating a cake!", error);
  }
});
```
