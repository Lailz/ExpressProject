To create a new cake, we will send the new cake's data through the body of the url. For Express to handle the body of a url, we will use a middleware called `body-parser`. So let's start with installing it:

```shell
yarn add body-parser
```

Then in `app.js` we will require it and call the `bodyParser.json()` method which will parse the body as JSON data:

```javascript
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

Make sure to call this middleware method **before** your routes.

Next, we will import the dummy database methods in `app.js`:

```javascript
const cakeMethods = require("./cakeMethods");
```

Now let's write our `create` route. Since the request is passing data to our route, we will use the `POST` method:

```javascript
app.post("/cakes", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newCake = await cakeMethods.createCake(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(newCake);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error while creating a new cake", error);
  }
});
```

The methods in our dummy database are asynchronous, so we will use `async` and `await`. Also, to catch any errors we will use a `try catch` statement.

We call the `createCake` method and pass it `req.body` which has the data passed in the url's body.

Finally we will send the `newCake` as a response. Since the default success response status is `200` we will change it to `201` which means that the item is created successfully.
