To retrieve the list of all cakes we will update our previously created route so that now it will fetch the list from our dummy database through the methods in `cakeMethods`.

The methods in `cakeMethods` are asynchronous, so we will use `async` and `await`. Also, to catch any errors we will use a `try catch` statement.

We call the `getCakes` method and it will return the list of all cakes from the database.

Finally we will send the `cakes` as a response.

```javascript
app.get("/cakes", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const cakes = await cakeMethods.getCakes();
    res.json(cakes);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error while fetching cakes", error);
  }
});
```

To fetch one cake by its ID, we will pass the route parameter `cakeId` to the `getCake` method, and we will return the fetched cake as a response.

```javascript
app.get("/cakes/:cakeId", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { cakeId } = req.params;
    const cake = await cakeMethods.getCake(cakeId);
    res.json(cake);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error while fetching cake", error);
  }
});
```
