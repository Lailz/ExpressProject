Our first route will send a list of all cakes as a response.

Since the request wants to **fetch** data, we will use the `get` method. We called the URL `/cakes` and the we will pass the array of cakes to the `res.json` method.

```javascript
app.get("/cakes", (req, res) => res.json(cakes));
```

This is what the response will look like in your browser:
